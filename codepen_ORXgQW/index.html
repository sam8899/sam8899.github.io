<font color="b366ff"> Hi my name is Samantha Mason. I have been in Primerica ever since i was born. My parents have been in the business for about 20 years. I was a Primerica child or thats what my parents clients and business partners called me. I was alive when fly outs were a thing and I ate slept and breathed the business. I was brought up with the motto that primerica " takes you from where you are to where you want to be", I have even seen the company undergo a logo change and I'm only 17 years old. I attended a convencion on September of 2016. During the convention they were giving out the awards and announcing the names of the people that made over 30,000 a month and I asked my dad Ifhe wanted them to call his name. He repied "hell yeah" then I continued to ask him what he would do if you were p there calling my name and he replied with "I'd cry". So I said ok in 1 year you're up there and in 2 years you are calling my name. We shook on it, documented it and proceded with the convention.
